This directory contains exercises and solutions for a hands-on
OpenMP course.  Information about these programs can be found
in the comments and in the slides from the course.

To use these programs, edit the file "make.def" to match your
system (i.e. tell it the name of your compiler and the flags 
to use. Then build the programs and test them

   make test

The solutions directory uses the same make.def file so to build
the solutions, just type "make test".  

We have tested these programs under Linux and OSX with the gnu and 
Intel compilers.
