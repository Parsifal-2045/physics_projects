## Instructions

Beginners
* look at the `OrderedVector` code
* compile and run `playwithsort.cpp`. See the ordering
* modify `playwithsort.cpp` and reuse `OrderedVector` with `Complex`

Intermediary
* improve `OrderedVector` to template the ordering
* test reverse ordering of strings (from the last letter)
* test order based on [Manhattan distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry) with complex type

Bonus
* check the implementation of `Complex`
* try ordering complex of complex
